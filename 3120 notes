Def of Business
A project is a sequence of unique, complex and connected activities that have one goal or purpose and that must be completed by a specific time, within budget, and according to specification.

Better def
A project is a sequence of finite dependent activities whose  completion results in the delivery of the expected business value that validated doing the projsuccessfulect

Program
	A collection of related projects, which may need to be completed in a specific order for the program to be complete.
	Programs may have more than one goal
Portfolio
	A collection of projects that share a common link to one another.

Projects are about change while business as usual are about daily operation

Project Management Def
 project management is "the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements"



(Not really good)





Project management lifecycle
A sequence of processes that include
• scoping
• planning
• launching
• monitoring and controlling
• closing

Regardless of approach and methodology used, project management always begins with scoping processes and ends with closing processes. Each process is done at least once, and maybe many times, and there is always a logical order to the process.
To determine an appropriate approach, the project manager must understand the certainty of the solution -- a continuum ranging from:
• high certainty -- both the goal and the solution are clearly defined OR
• some uncertainty -- the goal is clearly defined but the solution isn't
• major uncertainty -- neither goal nor solution are clearly defined.

                                         PMLC Approaches, Figure 2-1 from Wysocki, page 41
Projects for which traditional project management approaches may be appropriate
• The goal and the solution are clear
• About 20% fall into this category, often includes infrastructure projects
• Little change expected
• Limitations
• Change intolerant




The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBoK)

The PMBoK is "the sum of knowledge within the professional of project management"
All project management lifecycles include the five process groups included in the PMBoK, they also relate to all ten PMBoK knowledge areas.
Five Process Groups
1. Initiating (or scoping) process group
2. Planning process group
3. Executing (or launching) process group
4. Monitoring and controlling process group
5. Closing process group
The process groups are not a project management lifecycle. They are simply groupings of processes by project phases. A specific project management lifecycle is defined using these processes.
Ten Knowledge Areas
The ten knowledge areas are present in all project management lifecycles. They define the processes and are often part of more than a single process group.
6. Project Integration Management
7. Project Scope Management
8. Project Time Management
9. Project Cost Management
10. Project Quality Management
• Quality Planning Process
• Quality Assurance Process
• Quality Control Process
11. Project Human Resource Management
12. Project Communications Management
• Who are project stakeholders?
• What do they need to know about the project?
• How should their needs be met?
13. Project Risk Management
• Risk Identification
• Risk Assessment
• Risk Mitigation
• Risk Monitoring
14. Project Procurement Managment
• Vendor Solicitation
• Vendor Evaluation
• Types of Contracts
• Contract Negotiation
• Vendor Management
15. Project Stakeholder Management

Steps to help you learn how to think critically
• Clarify your thinking, one thought at a time
• Elaborate what you mean until you are absolutely clear what you really mean
• Use examples that connect your thoughts to life experience
• Use analogies and metaphors to help others to connect your ideas to what they understand
The following format should help you clarify your thinking
I think …. (state your main point)
In other words … (elaborate your main point)
For example … (give an example of your main point)
To give you an analogy … (give an illustration of your main point)
Things to do that will help you to think critically
• Stick to the point
• Focus on the main problem or task : if no idea to start => start from anywhere. 
• Look for connections
• Does the information relate directly to the problem or task?
• Where do I need to focus my attention
• What are relevant viewpoints?
• What facts will help find an answer to the question?
• Question everything – the 5 whys2
• Don’t just accept - always ask for clarification
• When the problem is complex, formulate the question in several different ways
• Prepare – prior to a discussion think about what questions need answers and what will help you stay on track
• Be reasonable
• Be on the lookout for reasonable and unreasonable behaviours – yours and others
• What biases and assumptions might be affecting your response?
